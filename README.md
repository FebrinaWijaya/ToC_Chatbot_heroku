# TOC Chatbot Project 2019

## It's Vacation Time!
I am an international student from Indonesia.
And this chatbot will give you some recommendations about where you can go if you would like to travel to Indonesia. Why I made this chatbot because usually my Taiwanese friends will always ask me about having vacation in Indonesia.
